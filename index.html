                    <p>
                        I’ve just heard some good news that’s going to make a lot of people a lot of dollars!<br>
                        <br>On the <b>13th of August at 11 AM ET/NY,</b> Neil Napier and the Kyvio team will be launching one of the biggest products of the year, EZLocal.<br>
                        <br>I’m very excited about this product and I can’t wait for you to see it.<br>
                        <br><b>EZLocal</b> is a brilliant piece of software that allows local businesses to create easy-to-use online booking pages to sell and schedule appointments for their services.<br>
                        <br>They can then share these pages on social media, their own websites, or anywhere online.<br>
                        <br>Anyone interested in the services can then book them online in <u>less than 3 minutes.</u><br>
                        <br><b>It’s simple, quick, and convenient.</b><br>
                        <br>Normally, making appointments for local services would require lengthy phone calls, filling out unnecessary forms, or an in-person visit.<br>
                        <br>It can be very frustrating and time-consuming.<br>
                        <br>EZLocal removes all of that frustration and makes it easy for customers to schedule appointments for any service they need.<br>
                        <br>What I like the most about this software is that so many local business owners are going to benefit immensely from it.<br>

                        There are at least over 100 local businesses in your area that would love it if their customers could easily make appointments for their services online.<br><br>
                        This is where it gets exciting because <b>exactly one hour before EZLocal goes live,</b> Neil Napier & his team will be hosting a special training call just for you.<br><br>

                    <p style="padding-top:20px;">Hey,</p>
                    <p>
                        If you were to start up a local service-based local business right now, would you want your customers to be able to book your services online?<br><br>
                        I know I would because the more convenient my business is the more clients I would get to work with. <br><br>
                        A lot of people don’t mind setting appointments over the phone or in person but there are other people who simply don’t have the time to do so. <br><br>
                        For those people, it would be much easier to just book an appointment online. <br><br>
                        This is why businesses <b>gain an average revenue increase of 27%</b> when using online booking systems.<br><br>
                        In fact, 46% of all appointments for local services are made online.<br><br>
                        That means all local businesses that don’t use online booking systems are losing out on nearly half of their potential clients. <br><br>
                        <b>And guess what?</b><br><br>
                        The majority of local business owners are completely unaware of these facts. <br><br>
                        <b>So, why am I telling you this?</b> I’m glad you asked. <br><br>
                        See, if you could help these business owners set up online booking systems to sell their services you could literally double their clientele overnight!<br><br>
                        And now there is an extremely easy way that you can do this thanks to a brand new software called <b>EZLocal.</b><br><br>
                        It’s brought to you by none other than Neil Napier & his team, some of my favorite experts in local marketing. <br><br>
                        EZLocal will allow you to create online booking pages for any local business in minutes. <br><br>

                <p style="padding-top:20px;">Hey,</p>

                <!-- The very long stuff -->
                <p>
                    EZLocal goes live tomorrow on the <b>13th of August at 11 AM!</b><br><br>
                    I’m super excited about this launch but it’s going to change many lives and put a lot of dollars into the pockets of action-takers.<br><br>
                    I can’t lie, I love this software because it actually helps local business owners to get more clients and make more money.<br><br>
                    <b>And it’s really simple too.</b><br><br>
                    With just a few clicks, EZLocal creates stunning online booking pages which make it easy for clients to schedule appointments for local services.<br><br> 
                    So, not only are local businesses benefiting, but their clients are as well.<br><br>
                    It makes life <u>EZ-er</u> for everyone.<br><br>
                    And the good thing is that most local businesses are not using an online booking system and are forcing their customers to set appointments via in-person visits or annoying phone calls.<br><br>
                    <b>That’s not convenient in the 21st century, and definitely not ideal in the digital age.</b><br><br>
                    But local business owners already know this. They know how important having an online presence is and they are just waiting for your assistance.<br><br>
                    With EZLocal, you can easily sell online booking pages to the local business owner.<br><br>
                    <b>Yes! It’s an easy sell.</b><br><br>
                    And there are so many different business owners you can sell to.<br><br>
                    <b>For example…</b><br><br>
                    You can create an online booking page for a local fitness coach.<br><br>
                    He can then place the URL for that page in his Instagram or Facebook bio where prospects can schedule workout days with him. It’s quick and convenient plus he doesn’t even need a website.<br><br>
                    This is just one tiny example but as you can see, this is a huge opportunity right now.<br><br>
                    If you want to learn more about how you can make a life-changing income with EZLocal <b>then you absolutely have to register for this pre-launch webinar.</b> [your link]<br><br>
                    On the webinar, you are going to learn everything you need to set up a stellar 6-figure business that you and your clients will love. <br><br>
                    It’s being hosted by Neil Napier & his team and trust me, they know their stuff.<br><br>
                    The webinar goes live exactly 1 hour before the launch at <b>10 AM ET/NY on August 13th</br> (that’s tomorrow) and you shouldn’t miss it for the world!<br><br>
